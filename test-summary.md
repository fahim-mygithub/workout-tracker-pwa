# Video Display Feature Test Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Exercise Name Parsing and Fuzzy Matching
- Created `exerciseMatching.ts` utility that:
  - Extracts exercise names from workout strings (removes sets/reps/weights)
  - Implements fuzzy matching to find exercises in directory
  - Handles word order variations (e.g., "barbell incline press" vs "incline barbell press")

### 2. WorkoutPageV2 Integration
- Updated `WorkoutPageV2.tsx` to use fuzzy matching when loading exercises
- Integrated video links from matched exercises into workout data
- Fixed navigation to ensure WorkoutPageV2 is used instead of old WorkoutPage

### 3. ExerciseVideo Component Integration
- Replaced complex video display logic in `ExerciseItem.tsx` with `ExerciseVideo` component
- Component handles:
  - Multiple video views with navigation
  - "Not Found In Directory" message for missing videos
  - Video loading errors

### 4. Navigation Fix
- Updated `TextWorkoutBuilder.tsx` to navigate with state instead of dispatching to Redux
- This ensures WorkoutPageV2 receives workout data in the expected format

## Current Status

### Working âœ…
- Exercise name parsing removes sets/reps notation
- Fuzzy matching finds exercises with name variations
- Navigation to WorkoutPageV2 with proper state passing
- Video display component integrated

### Issues Identified
- The old WorkoutPage is still being used in some flows
- Need to verify exercise directory is loaded before matching
- Some exercises might still show "Not Found" if matching threshold is too strict

## Test Results
- Exercise directory loads successfully (CSV file found and loaded)
- Fuzzy matching logic works correctly in unit tests
- UI components render without errors
- Navigation occurs but may need additional verification

## Next Steps
1. Verify WorkoutPageV2 is consistently used across all workout start flows
2. Test with actual exercise data to ensure videos display correctly
3. Fine-tune fuzzy matching threshold if needed
4. Add more comprehensive error handling
