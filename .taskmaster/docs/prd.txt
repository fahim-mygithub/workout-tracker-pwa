Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Workout Tracker Progressive Web App

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Workout Tracker PWA is a mobile-first Progressive Web Application designed for gym users who want a fast, intelligent workout tracking system. The app's killer feature is natural language workout planning - users can type "5x5 Bench ss 3x10 pushups" and the app instantly parses this into a structured workout. Built with React and Firebase, it offers offline-first functionality, smart rest timers, and exercise-specific back-off calculations.

2. PRODUCT VISION
